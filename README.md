# jsonParser
A small web-based project to parse and filter JSON files on the client side.

Working example at http://projects.ed-moore.net/jsonFilter

## Notes
* The script will look at your JSON file and look for a .data attribute. If this is not present, it will use your entire JSON file instead.
